Selection sort
Selection sort is not stable. It has O(n^2) complexity. Selection sort has the longest time to sort all files.
Quick sort
Quick sort is not stable, sometimes faster and sometimes slower. It runs O(n^2) at worst case. And O(n log n) at best 
and average case. 
Merge sort
Merge sort has O(n log n) for worst, best and average case. It is a stable sorting method.

Selection sort takes the longest times to sort. 
It is difficult to accurately time very short activities on a computer, because the operating system often does other things
to the detriment of your performance analysis. Over long periods of time, these other activities get averaged out, but short
programs that happen to run when OS activity spikes do not get the benefit of that implicit filter. Sorting inputs multiple times will reduce the noise in this processes by allowing you to measure an average over many runs.
For 10000000 words, Selection takes about 1 hours to sort. Quick takes 58 minutes, merge takes 55 minutes
